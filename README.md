- the **styles.css** file located under the **_stylesheets_** folder, it's already linked with the **_index.html_** and add your own custom styles
- or if you prefer you can use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/), it's also already linked with the **_index.html_**
<p>&nbsp;</p>
